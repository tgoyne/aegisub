<h1>FFmpegSource Documentation</h1>
<p>
Opens files using ffmpeg and nothing else. May be frame accurate on good days. The source is BSD licensed and can be obtained from https://spaceboyz.net/svn/aegisub/trunk/FFmpegSource. The precompiled binary is GPL licensed.
</p>

<h2>Compatibility - Video</h2>
<ul>
<li>AVI, MKV, MP4, FLV: Frame accurate</li>
<li>WMV: Frame accurate(?) but avformat seems to pick keyframes relatively far away</li>
<li>OGM: Messed up first frame and seeking produces smearing with seekmode=3, incredibly slow seeking without, remux to mkv or avi</li>
<li>VOB: No rff flags applied, frame accurate?</li>
<li>MPG: Seeking seems to be off by one or two frames now and then</li>
<li>M2TS, TS: Linear access only (seekmode=-1)</li>
<li>Image files: most formats can be opened if seekmode=-1 is set</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility - Audio</h2>
<ul>
<li>Should be sample accurate in all containers with audio cache</li>
<li>Can produce very bad distortions when caching is not used for certain formats like aac</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<b>FFmpegSource(string source, int vtrack = -1, int atrack = -2, string timecodes, bool vcache = true, string vcachefile, string acachefile, string pp, int ppquality = 6, int threads = -1, int seekmode = 1)</b><br />
</p>

<p>
Note that the audio cache will always be created when opening files with audio and that it will be huge since it stores all audio as raw signed 16/24/32 bit pcm, unsigned 8 bit pcm or as float, using flac to compress it is also possible to reduce the size by half.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFAudioSource(string source, int atrack = -1, string acachefile, string acachefile2)</b><br />
</p>

<p>
Experimental, may or may not be accurate enough for real usage.
</p>

<p>
<b>FFPP(clip, string pp, int ppquality = 6)</b><br />
  Separate postprocessing which also seems to include a few simple deinterlacers
</p>

<p>
<b>SWScale(clip, width = -1, height = -1, resizer = "BICUBIC", colorspace = "")</b><br />
  Separate postprocessing which also seems to include a few simple deinterlacers
</p>

<p>
<b>source:</b>
  Source file.
</p>

<p>
<b>atrack &amp; vtrack:</b>
  Track number as seen by the relevant demuxer, starts from 0, -1 means it will pick the first suitable track and -2 means it's disabled.
</p>


<p>
<b>timecodes:</b>
  File to output timecodes to, if the file exists it will be overwritten.
</p>

<p>
<b>vcache:</b>
  Write video indexing information to a file for later use. This setting does not control if The video index is loaded which it always is if it exists.
</p>

<p>
<b>vcachefile, acachefile &amp; acachefile2:</b>
  Specifies the file to store the index information or raw audio in, if nothing is specified (source).ffv(tracknumber)cache is used for video and (source).ffa(d if FFAudioSource is used)(tracknumber)cache for audio. The second audio cache file is only required/created when not opening matroska files.
</p>

<p>
<b>pp:</b>
  See the table below for a full description, an empty string means no processing. It is recommended to avoid the autoq option since it's currently unknown what effect it will have on the processing.
</p>

<p>
<b>ppquality:</b>
  The quality to use for the specified postprocessing. Valid values are 0-6 where 0 usually means that no actual processing is done.
</p>

<p>
<b>threads:</b>
  Sets the number of decoder threads used. Defaults to the number of cpus reported by windows. Ignored by lavc if the used decoder doesn't implement it.
</p>

<p>
<b>seekmode:</b>
  Force how seeking is handled, has no effect on matroska files which always use the equivalent of seekmode=1<br />
    <b>-1:</b> linear access without rewind, will throw an error if each successive requested frame number isn't bigger than the last one, only intended for opening images but might work on well with some obscure video format<br />
    <b>0:</b> linear access, the definition of slow but should make some formats "usable"<br />
    <b>1:</b> safe normal, bases seeking decisions on the reported keyframe positions<br />
    <b>2:</b> unsafe normal, same as 1 but no error will be thrown if the exact destination has to be guessed<br />
    <b>3:</b> aggressive, seek in the forward direction even if no closer keyframe is known to exist, only useful for testing and containers where avformat doesn't report keyframes properly
</p>

<p>
<b>width &amp; height:</b>
  Width and height to resize to. Value below or equal to 0 is the same as specifying the input dimensions.
</p>

<p>
<b>resizer:</b>
  Selects the resizer used for resampling the chroma planes and normal resizing. The available methods are: FAST_BILINEAR, BILINEAR, BICUBIC, X, POINT, AREA, BICUBLIN, GAUSS, SINC, LANCZOS and SPLINE.
</p>

<p>
<b>colorspace:</b>
  The colorspace to convert to. The names are YV12, YUY2, RGB24, RGB32 and the empty string for same as input.
</p>
