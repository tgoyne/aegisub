Please visit http://aegisub.net to download latest version

= 1.11 beta - 2006.xx.xx ===========================

- Support reading SSA/ASS files with intermixed V4 and V4+ Styles sections (jfs)
- Fixed loading of sections with unexpected cases. (AMZ)
- Changes to Audio Spectrum: (jfs)
  o Calculation/drawing code is now multithreaded, meaning it runs faster on SMP (eg. dual-core) systems
  o The palette is changed
  o Rendering now more accurately represents actual signal power
  o Use vertical zoom slider to amplify/dampen displayed signal strength (useful for better visualisation of quiet sections, or easier picking out the dominating frequencies in noisy sections)


= 1.10 beta - 2006.08.07 ===========================

- Always defaults to Audio Cache=1 (ram) now (Myrsloik)
- Automation: Added xor(a,b) boolean logical function to utils.lua (jfs)
- Automation: Various changes to karaskel.lua and karaskel-adv.lua: (jfs)
   o Added some debug-calls (which are disabled by default; aegisub.output_debug is replaced with a do-nothing function (you can change this in karaskel.lua)
   o The regular aegisub.output_debug is aliased to aegisub.output_warning, in order to always be able to show real warnings, in case something goes wrong
   o Fixed bug, triggered when a line had a style not defined in the subs. A warning is now shown instead.
- Fixed bug in parser that would cause Aegisub to crash if you had a \fn without parameters and tried to pick font. (AMZ)
- Fixed crash when opening audio that appeared in 1.08 (Myrsloik)
- Karaoke mode changes: (jfs)
   o New syllable-splitter: Click "split" to enable splitting-mode, click in syllable view to set split-markers, then click commit to do the splitting
   o The correct \k tag (\k, \kf, \ko, \K) is now kept when splitting/joining
   o When editing karaoke-timing for a line and not splitting/joining, all tags are kept intact, so only the \k tag timings are changed
   o Right-click in karaoke area to change the tag (\k, \kf, \ko)
   o Click and drag to select multiple syllables
- Fixed bug where \t tags (among others?) would lose their parameters when being rebuilt (happens with Framerate Transport export filter, Automation and during the karaoke timing improvements listed above, among other places) (jfs)
- Implemented FexTracker, for automatically tracking positions on the video and placing text accordingly (Tentacle)
- Drag-and-drop files onto the program no longer causes the subs to be unloaded every time, even if no subs were dropped (jfs)
- 1,1+2 recombining lines where 1 is a substring of 2 no longer causes incorrect behavior. 1+2,2 similarly fixed. This fix also gives more sanity-checking in the recombining (jfs)
- Replaced the subtitles grid with a custom control, which should hopefully behave and look better. (AMZ) Changes are:
   o Currently active line is now highlighted with a border.
   o The grid can optionally no longer receive focus (this behavior is disabled by default, change "Grid Allow Focus" to 0 in config.dat to prevent it from getting focus).
   o Fixed bug related to tag cycling, which would reset grid, move video and force a refresh of everything (slow, and could undo uncommited changes).
   o Rows colliding with the currently active one will now be highlighted in grid.
   o Selected comments are now highlighted in a different color.
   o Fixed behavior of deleting and joining lines on grid.
   o Inserted lines will now be automatically selected.
   o Alt+Click on grid will activate the clicked line, without modifying selection.
   o Actor and effect columns are now only visible if they are being used.
   o Double clicking a row will jump video to it, regardless of auto go to option.
   o Unhandled keypresses in grid will now be sent to the audio display.
- Toolbar will now properly disable the Jump To buttons if more than one line is selected. (AMZ)
- Fixed the toolbar "grey area" glitch (was actually a wxWidgets issue). (AMZ)
- Default video zoom can now be set in config.dat and is defaulted to 100%. (AMZ)
- Fixed crash in Translation and Styling assistants, when you attempted to move past end of file, and then play. (AMZ)
- Fixed linked commit of times, so it will only commit both times if the other was changed (to prevent damage when editing multiple lines). (AMZ)
- Fixed some bugs related to inserting overrides via the buttons over the edit box. (AMZ)
- Implemented Redo (and there was much rejoicing). (AMZ)
- Fonts collector will now default collection to same folder as script (Set to "?script" on config.dat). (AMZ)
- Alt+Left/Right on the video seek bar will now seek by increments of 10 frames (increment is customizeable in config.dat). (AMZ)
- Added a simple audio resync method for video playback. (AMZ)
- Audio timing will now apply to all selected lines, as well as active line. (AMZ)
- Added a volume slider bar to audio mode. (AMZ)
- Fixed some internal workings, which should make Aegisub use considerably less RAM (especially for large Karaoke files, 8-10x less RAM usage was measured with a 9 MB file). (AMZ)
- Aegisub will now dump the stack to stack.txt when it crashes with a fatal exception, which might or might not work. (AMZ)
- Audio display in SSA mode will no longer ignore clicks if it wasn't focused (AMZ)
- The font override button in the subtitles edit box can now modify font size, italics, bold and underline as well as font face (no strikeout, as wx does not provide an interface to access that data). (AMZ)
- Now requires Avisynth 2.5.6a or later, added an option ("allow ancient avisynth") to override it to config.dat. (Myrsloik)
- Added reading of keyframe and timecode data from Matroska files (which are still not recommended, due to their dependency on DirectShowSource). (AMZ)
- Added forums and bugtracker to Help menu. (AMZ)
- Fixed Fonts Collector behavior with font shortcuts. (AMZ)
- Better error reporting when loading Automation scripts (jfs)

- Search and Replace dialogue made modeless. (Pomyk)
- Fixed bug related to moving elements up and down in File Export dialog. (Pomyk)
- Scrollbar and sliders in audio box can no longer receive focus. (Pomyk)

- Saving back to SRT directly (that is, via "save", not "export" or "save as") is now allowed, as long as no data will be lost. (AMZ)
- Aegisub now supports file attachments, which are stored decoded (to save memory) and are not part of the undo stack (for the same reason). Previously, they were simply left ignored in the file as unknown lines. (AMZ)

= 1.09 beta - 2006.01.16 ===========================

- Implemented Timing Post-Processor dialog to automatically add lead-in/lead-out, scene timing and adjascence adjustment for sharp-timed subs (AMZ)
- Aegisub is now translateable, with proper localization files. (AMZ) Available now are:
   o Brazilian Portuguese
   o French (thanks to TechNiko and Kurasu)
   o Russian (thanks to ]thrash_sensei[)
   o German (thanks to equinox)
- Fixed saving of hotkeys (AMZ)
- Fixed behavior of Insert key in Translation Assistant (AMZ)
- Ctrl+Enter now previews in translation assistant (AMZ)
- Fixed "make times continuous" bug (AMZ)
- Checks if there's enough free space when using disk cache and asks if disk cache should be used when there isn't enough ram available (Myrsloik)
- Always enforces the set memory limit for avisynth even if no video is opened (Myrsloik)
- Fixed crashes when not enough memory could be allocated for ram cache (Myrsloik)
- Properties dialog will no longer flag file as modified if nothing changed (AMZ)
- The config.dat file is now fully documented again, for the first time since beta 1.00... let's see how long it lasts. (TheFluff)
- Selected line is now properly enabled on audio display when audio is loaded (AMZ)
- Cosmetic improvements to toolbar (AMZ)
- Improved command line and drag-and-drop opening of files (extended to allow video and audio at the same time as well) (AMZ)
- Fixed audio glitches when using disk cache and scrolling the audio display while playing (Myrsloik)
- Improved the ram cache allocation so it should work for really large files if enough ram is available (Myrsloik)
- Fixed exporting of SSA styles (AMZ)
- Automation: The precalculation step in karaskel.lua is now in a function by itself, precalc_syllable_data (jfs)
- Automation: New function added to utils.lua, string.headtail(s): treats s as a list of words separated by spaces, returns two strings, the first word (the head) and the rest of the string (the tail), like car/cdr (jfs)
- Fixed behavior of dialog that asks you to change script resolution based on video resolution (AMZ)
- Video and audio displays can now be hidden via the View menu (AMZ)
- Translation assistant now shows proper text color (AMZ)
- Translation assistant now shows total line count (AMZ)
- Hotkeys for translation and styling assistants are now customizeable (AMZ)
- Default character encoding for saving can now be set via the evil "save charset" in config.dat. (AMZ) A few examples:
   o "save charset=UTF-8" - Default setting. RECOMMENDED.
   o "save charset=UTF-16" - Saves as UTF-16 instead of UTF-8. This solves issues if you must deal with a program that can't support UTF-8, such as ancient textsub or wordpad.
   o "save charset=local" - Kills unicode support in saving subtitles, and saves as local charset. THIS OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED! It will, however, make scripts compatible with Medusa and other non-unicode programs.
   o "save charset=Shift_JIS" - Same as above, but saves as Shift_JIS (japanese script). NOT RECOMMENDED!
   o "save charset=ISO-8859-1" - Same as above, but saves as ISO-8859-1 (western script). NOT RECOMMENDED!
   Remember: You can always save to another charset via the File->Export option. This is much safer!
- Setting "Use nonstandard milisecond times" in config.dat makes Aegisub use miliseconds instead of centiseconds for ASS times. DO NOT use it unless you know EXACTLY why you should! NORMAL VSFILTER CAN'T HANDLE THIS. (AMZ)
- Resolution resampler now affects drawing commands as well (AMZ)
