// A note about this file:
// You can exclude version.cpp from your build (but still include version.h),
// and instead provide your own, custom version.cpp file, call it eg.
// my_version.cpp. This way you can easily provide a custom build notice.
//
// If you often distribute SVN builds you are encouraged to label your builds
// in this manner.
