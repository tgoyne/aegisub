This directory contains flexible, configurable Automation scripts to do common jobs,
without having to do programming.

You can load these scripts into an ASS file in Aegisub, and apply an effect without
doing more than writing ASS override tags.


WARNING!
DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN FILES TO THIS DIRECTORY,
they will be deleted when you uninstall/upgrade Aegisub.
This also means it's unwise to modify these files, if you want to keep your
changes to them.
