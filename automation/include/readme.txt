This directory contains standard include files for Automation.
By default, this directory is included in the Automation Include Path, which
means the files here are always available for use with the include() function.

See the Aegisub help and the individual files in this directory for more
information on their purpose and contents.

You may add your own files to this directory, they will not be touched upon
uninstalling/upgrading Aegisub. The standard files here will, however, be
removed/replaced on uninstall/upgrade, so you are advised not to edit those!
