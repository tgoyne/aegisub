-- Aegisub Automation include file
-- The purpose of this include file is to provide a default skeleton for Automation scripts,
-- where you, as a scripter, can just override the functions you need to override.

-- The following functions can be overridden:
--   do_syllable - called for each syllable in a line
--   do_line_decide - called to decide whether to process a line or not
--   do_line_start - called at the beginning of each line
--   do_line_end - called at the end of each line
--   do_line - Process an entire line
-- By default, these functions are all assigned to the following default functions
-- Your functions should obviously use the same parameter lists etc.
-- Note that if you override do_line, none of the other functions will be called!


-- All the functions mentioned here are, however, wrapped in some code that pre-calculates some
-- extra data for the lines and syllables.

-- The following fields are added to lines:
--   i - The index of the line in the file, 0 being the first
--   width - Rendered width of the line in pixels (using the line style, overrides are not taken into account)
--   height - Rendered height of the line in pixels (note that rotation isn't taken into account either)
--   ascent - Height of the ascenders, in pixels (notice that this looks like the output of text_extents?)
--   extlead - External leading of the font, in pixels (well, it is!)
--   centerleft - Pixel position of the left edge of the line, when horisontally centered on screen
--   centerright - Pixel pisition of the right edge of the line, when horisontally centered on screen
--   duration - Duration of the line in miliseconds
--   styleref - The actual style table for the style this line has

-- The following fields are added to syllables:
--   i - The index of the syllable in the line, 0 being the first (and usually empty) one
--   width, height, ascent, extlead - Same as for lines
--   left - Left pixel position of the syllable, relative to the start of the line
--   center - Center pixel position of the syllable, also relative to the start of the line
--   right - Right pixel position of the syllable, relative again
--   start_time - Start time of the syllable, in miliseconds, relative to the start of the line
--   end_time - End time of the syllable, similar to start_time


-- Return a replacement text for a syllable
function default_do_syllable(meta, styles, config, line, syl)
	return syl.text
