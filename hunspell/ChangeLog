        * hunspell/*: new feature: morphological generation,
          also fix experimental morphological analysis and stemming.
        - new API functions and improved API:
            - analyze(word): (instead of morph()) morphological analysis
            - stem(word): stemming
            - stem(list): stemming based on the result of an analysis
            - generate(word, word2): morphological generation 
            - generate(word, list): morphological generation 
            - add(word): add word to the run-time dictionary (renamed put_word())
            - add_with_affix(word, word2): (renamed put_word_pattern()):
              add word to the run-time dictionary with affix flags of the
              second parameter: all affixed forms of the user words will be
              recognised by the spell checker. Especially useful for
              agglutinative languages.
	    - remove(word): remove word from the run-time dictionary (not
	      implemented)
        - see manual and hunspell/hunspell.hxx header and tests/morph.*
        * tests/morph.*: test data, example for morphological analysis,
          stemming and generation

        * tools/analyze, tools/chmorph: extended and new demo applications:
        - analyze (originally hunmorph): analyses and stems input words,
          generates word forms from input word pairs.
        - chmorph: morphological transformation filter

        * configure.ac, hunspell/makefile.am: set library version number.
          Bug reported by Rene Engelhard.

        * affentry.cxx, affixmgr.cxx: new pattern matching algorithm in
          condition checking of affix rules instead of the Dömölki-algorithm:
        - Unlimited condition length (instead of max. 8 characters).
        - Less memory consumption, especially useful for affix rich languages:
          5,4 MB memory savings with hu_HU dictionary.
        - Speed change depends from dictionaries and CPU caches: English spell
          checking is 4% faster on Linux words with en_US dictionary, Hungarian
          spell checking is 25% slower on most frequent words of Hungarian
          Webcorpus.

        * tests/sug.*, sugutf.*: updated test data (use "a" and "lot"
          dictionary items instead of "a lot".)

        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: free(csconv) instead of delete csconv.
          Report and patch by Sylvain Paschein in Mozilla Issue 398268.

        * suggestmgr.cxx, tools/hunspell.cxx: bad spelling of "misspelled".
          Ubuntu Bug #134792, patch by Malcolm Parsons.

        * tests/base_utf.*: use Unicode apostrophe instead of 8-bit one.
        
        * hunspell.cxx, hashmgr.cxx: add(): use HashMgr::add()

          Diego Pettenò, Kevin F. Quinn)

2006-02-02 Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu>:
        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: suggest(): replace "fooBar" -> "foo bar" suggestions
          with "fooBar" ->"foo Bar" (missing spaces are typical OCR bugs).
          Bug reported by stowrob at OOo in Issue 58202.
        * src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx: twowords(): permit 1-character words.
          (restore MySpell's original behavior). Here: "aNew" -> "a New".
        * tests/i58202.*: test data

        * src/parsers/textparser.cxx: fix Unicode tokenization in is_wordchar()
          (extra word characters (WORDCHARS) didn't work on big-endian platforms).
          
        * src/hunspell/{csutil,affixmgr}.cxx: inline isSubset(), isRevSubset():
          little speed optimalization for languages with rich morphology.

        * src/tools/hunspell.cxx: fix bad --with-ui and --with-readline compiling
          when (N)curses is missing. Reported by Daniel Naber.

2006-01-19 Tor Lillqvist <tml@novell.com>
        * src/hunspell/csutil.cxx: mystrsep(): fix locale-dependent isspace() tokenization

2006-01-06 András Tímár <timar@fsf.hu>
        * src/hunspell/{hashmgr.hxx,hunspell.cxx}: fix Visual C++ compiling errors

2006-01-05 Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu>:
        * COPYING: set GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-license for Mozilla integration.
          Rationale: Mozilla source code contains an old MySpell version
          with GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-license. (MPL license is a copyleft license, similar
          to the LGPL, but it acts on file level.)
        * COPYING.LGPL: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 (LGPL)
        * COPYING.MPL: Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL)
        * license.hunspell, src/hunspell/license.hunspell: GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-license

        * src/hunspell/{affixmgr,hashmgr}.*: AF, AM alias definitions in affix file:
          compression of flag sets and morphological descriptions (see manual,
          and tests/alias* test files).
          Rationale: Alias compression is also good for loading time and memory
          efficiency, not only smaller resources.
        * src/tools/makealias: alias compression utility
          (usage: ./makealias file.dic file.aff)
        * tests/alias{,2,3}: AF, AM tests
        * man/hunspell.4: add AF, AM documentation
        * src/hunspell/affentry.cxx, atypes.hxx: add new opts bits (aeALIASM, aeALIASF)

        * tools/hunspell, src/parser/*, src/hunspell/*: Hunspell program
          tokenizes Unicode texts (only with UTF-8 encoded dictionaries).
          Missing Unicode tokenization reported by Björn Jacke, Egmont Koblinger, 
          Jess Body and others.
          Note: Curses interactive interface hasn't worked perfectly yet.
        * tests/*.tests: remove -1 parameters of Hunspell
        * tests/*.{good,wrong}: remove tabulators

        * src/hunspell/{hunspell,affixmgr}.cxx: BREAK option: break words at
          specified break points and checking word parts separately (see manual).
          Note: COMPOUNDRULE is better (or will be better) for handling dashes and
          other compound joining characters or character strings. Use BREAK, if you
          want check words with dashes or other joining characters and there is no time
          or possibility to describe precise compound rules with COMPOUNDRULE.
        * tests/break.*: BREAK example.

        * src/hunspell/{affixmgr,hunspell}.cxx: add CHECKSHARPS declaration instead
          of LANG de_DE definitions to handle German sharp s in both spelling and
          suggestion.
        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: With CHECKSHARPS, uppercase words are valid
          with both lower sharp s (it's is optional for names in German legal texts)
          and SS (MÜßIG, MÜSSIG). Missing lower sharp s form reported by Björn Jacke. 
        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: KEEPCASE flag on a sharp s word has a special
          meaning with CHECKSHARPS declaration: KEEPCASE permits capitalisation and SS upper 
          casing of a sharp s word (Müßig and MÜSSIG), but forbids the upper cased form 
          with lower sharp s character(s): *MÜßIG.
        * tests/germancompounding*: add CHECKSHARPS, remove LANG
        * tests/checksharps*: add CHECKSHARPS and KEEPCASE, remove LANG

        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: improved suggestions:
        - suggestions for pressed Caps Lock problems: macARONI -> macaroni
        - suggestions for long shift problems: MAcaroni -> Macaroni, macaroni
        - suggestions for KEEPCASE words: KG -> kg
        * src/hunspell/csutil.cxx: fix mystrrep() function:
        - suggestions for lower sharp s in uppercased words: MÜßIG -> MÜSSIG
        * tests/checksharps{,utf}.sug: add tests for mystrrep() fix

        * src/hunspell/hashmgr.cxx: Now dictionary words can contain slashes 
          with the "\/" syntax. Problem reported by Frederik Fouvry.

        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: fix bad duplicate filter in suggest().
          (Suggesting some capitalised compound words caused program crash
          with Hungarian dictionary, OOo Issue 59055).

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: fix bad defcpd_check() call in compound_check().
          (Overlapping new COMPOUNDRULE and old compounding methods caused program
           crash at suggestion.)

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.{cxx,hxx}: check affix flag duplication at affix classes.
          Suggested by Daniel Naber.

        * src/hunspell/affentry.cxx: remove unused variable declarations (OOo i58338).
          Compiler warnings reported by András Tímár and Martin Hollmichel.

        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: morph(): not analyse bad mixed uppercased forms
          (fix Arabic morphological analysis with Buckwalter's Arabic transliteration)

        * src/hunspell/affentry.{cxx,hxx}, atypes.hxx: little memory optimization
          in affentry:
          - using unsigned char fields instead of short (stripl, appndl, numconds)
          - rename xpflg field to opts
          - removing utf8 field, use aeUTF8 bit of opts field

        * configure.ac: set tests/maputf.test to XFAILED on ARM platform.
          Fail reported by Rene Engelhard.

        * configure.ac: link Ncursesw library, if exists.

        * BUGS: add BUGS file

        * tests/complexprefixes2.*: test for morphological analysis with COMPLEXPREFIXES 
        
        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: use "COMPOUNDRULE" instead of
          "COMPOUND". The new name suggested by Bram Moolenaar.
        * tests/compoundrule*: modified and renamed compound.* test files

        * man/hunspell.4: AF, AM, BREAK, CHECKSHARPS, COMPOUNDRULE, KEEPCASE.
          - also new addition to the documentation:
          Header of the dictionary file define approximate dictionary size:
          ``A dictionary file (*.dic) contains a list of words, one per line.
          The first line of the dictionaries (except personal dictionaries)
          contains the _approximate_ word count (for optimal hash memory size).''
          Asked by Frederik Foudry.
          
          One-character replacements in REP definitions: ``It's very useful to
          define replacements for the most typical one-character mistakes, too:
          with REP you can add higher priority to a subset of the TRY suggestions
          (suggestion list begins with the REP suggestions).''

2005-11-11 Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu>:
        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: fix Unicode MAP errors (sorted only n-1
          characters instead of n ones in UTF-16 MAP character lists).
          Bug reported by Rene Engelhard.

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: fix infinite COMPOUND matching (default char
          type is unsigned on PowerPC, s390 and ARM platforms and it will never
          be negative). Bug reported by Rene Engelhard.
        
	* src/hunspell/{affixmgr,suggestmgr}.cxx: fix bad ONLYINCOMPOUND
          word suggestions.
	* tests/onlyincompound.sug: empty test file to check this fix.
          Bug reported by Björn Jacke.

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: fix backtracking in COMPOUND pattern matching.
        * tests/compound6.*: test files to check this fix.
        
        * csutil.cxx: set bigger range types in flag_qsort() and flag_bsearch().
        
        * affixmgr.hxx: set better type for cont_classes[] Boolean data (short -> char)
        
        * configure.ac, tests/automake.am: set platform specific XFAIL test
          (flagutf8.test on ARM platform)

2005-11-09 Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu>:
improvements:
        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: new and improved affix file parameters:

        - COMPOUND definitions: compound patterns with regexp-like matching.
          See manual and test files: tests/compound*.*
          Suggested by Bram Moolenaar.
          Also useful for simple word-level lexical scanning, for example
          analysing numbers or words with numbers (OOo Issue #53643):
          http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=53643
          Examples: tests/compound{4,5}.*.

        - NOSUGGEST flag: words signed with NOSUGGEST flag are not suggested.
          Proposed flag for vulgar and obscene words (OOo Issue #55498).
          Example: tests/nosuggest.*.
          Problem reported by bobharvey at OOo:
          http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=55498

        - KEEPCASE flag: Forbid capitalized and uppercased forms of words 
          signed with KEEPCASE flags. Useful for special ortographies 
          (measurements and currency often keep their case in uppercased
          texts) and other writing systems (eg. keeping lower case of IPA
          characters).

        - CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE: Forbid upper case characters at word bound in compounds.
          Examples: tests/checkcompoundcase* and tests/germancompounding.*

        - FLAG UTF-8: New flag type: Unicode character encoded with UTF-8.
          Example: tests/flagutf8.*.
          Rationale: Unicode character type can be more readable
          (in a Unicode text editor) than `long' or `num' flag type.

bug fixes:
        * src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: accept numbers and numbers with separators (i53643)
          Bug reported by skelet at OOo:
          http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=53643

	* src/hunspell/csutil.cxx: fix casing data in ISO 8859-13 character table.

        * src/hunspell/csutil.cxx: add ISO-8859-15 character encoding (i54980)
          Rationale: ISO-8859-15 is the default encoding of the French OpenOffice.org
          dictionary. ISO-8859-15 is a modified version of ISO-8859-1
          (latin-1) character encoding with French œ ligatures and euro
	  symbol. Problem reported by cbrunet at OOo in OOo Issue 54980:
          http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=54980

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: fix zero-byte malloc after a bad affix header.
          Patch by Harri Pitkänen.

	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx: fix bad NEEDAFFIX word suggestion
          in ngram suggestions. Reported by Daniel Naber and Friedel Wolff.

        * src/hunspell/hashmgr.cxx: fix bad white space checking in affix files.
          src/hunspell/{csutil,affixmgr}.cxx: add other white space separators.
          Problems with tabulators reported by Frederik Fouvry.

        * src/hunspell/*: replace system-dependent <license.*> #include
          parameters with quoted ones. Problem reported by Dafydd Jones.

	* src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: fix missing morphological analysis of dot(s)
          Reported by Trón Viktor.

changes:
	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: rename PSEUDOROOT to NEEDAFFIX.
	  Suggested by Bram Moolenaar.

        * src/hunspell/suggestmgr.hxx: Increase default maximum of 
          ngram suggestions (3->5). Suggested by Kevin Hendricks.

        * src/hunspell/htypes.hxx: Increase MAXDELEN for long affix flags.

        * src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx: modify (perhaps fix) Unicode map suggestion.
          tests/maputf test fail on ARM platform reported by Rene Engelhard.

        * src/hunspell/{affentry.cxx,atypes.hxx}: remove [PREFIX] and
          MISSING_DESCRIPTION messages from morphological analysis.
          Problems reported by Trón Viktor.

	* tests/germancompounding.{aff,good}: Add "Computer-Arbeit" test word.
          Suggested by Daniel Naber.

        * doc/man/hunspell.4: Proof-reading patch by Goldman Eleonóra.
          
        * doc/man/hunspell.4: Fix bad affix example (replace `move' with `work').
          Bug reported by Frederik Fouvry.
          
        * tests/*: new test files:
          affixes.*: simple affix compression example from Hunspell 4 manual page
          checkcompoundcase.*, checkcompoundcase2.*, checkcompoundcaseutf.*
          compound.*, compound2.*, compound3.*, compound4.*, compound5.*
          compoundflag.* (former compound.*)
          flagutf8.*: test for FLAG UTF-8
          germancompounding.*: simplification with CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE.
          germancompoundingold.* (former germancompounding.*)
          i53643.*: check numbers with separators
          i54980.*: ISO8859-15 test
          keepcase.*: test for KEEPCASE
          needaffix*.* (former pseudoroot*.* tests)
          nosuggest.*: test for NOSUGGEST

2005-09-19 Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu>:
	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx: improved ngram suggestion:
        - detect not neighboring swap characters (pernament -> permanent)
          Rationale: ngram method has a significant error with not neighboring
          swap characters, especially when swap is in the middle of the word.
        - suggest uppercase forms (unesco -> UNESCO, siggraph's -> SIGGRAPH's)
        - suggest only ngram swap character and uppercase form, if they exist.
          Rationale: swap character and casing equivalence give mutch better
          suggestions as any other (weighted) ngram suggestions.
        - add uppercase suggestion (PERMENANT -> PERMANENT)
          
        * src/hunspell/*: complete comparison with MySpell 3.2 (in OOo beta 2):
        - affixmgr.cxx: add missing numrep initialization
        - hashmgr.cxx: add_word(): don't allocate temporary records
        - hunspell.cxx: in suggest():
          - check capitalized words first (better sug. order for proper names),
          - check pSMgr->suggest() return value
          - set pSMgr->suggest() call to not optional in HUHCAP
        - csutil.cxx: fix bad KOI8-U -> koi8r_tbl reference in enc_entry encds
	- csutil.cxx: fix casing data in ISO 8859-2, Windows 1251 and KOI8-U
          encoding tables. Bug reported by Dmitri Gabinski.

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: improved compound word and other features
        - generalize hu_HU specific compound word features with new affix file
          parameters, suggested by Bram Moolenaar:
        - CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP: forbid word duplication in compounds (eg. foo|foo)
        - CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE: forbid triple letters in compounds (eg. foo|obar)
        - CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN: forbid patterns at word bounds in compounds
        - CHECKCOMPOUNDREP: using REP replacement table, forbid presumably bad
          compounds (useful for languages with unlimited number of compounds)
        - ONLYINCOMPOUND flag works also with words (see tests/onlyincompound.*)
          Suggested by Daniel Naber, Björn Jacke, Trón Viktor & Bram Moolenaar.
        - PSEUDOROOT works also with prefixes and prefix + suffix combinations
          (see tests/pseudoroot5.*). Suggested by Trón Viktor.
        - man/hunspell.4: updated man page

        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: fix incomplete prefix handling with twofold
          suffixes (delete unnecessary contclasses[] conditions in
          prefix_check_twosfx() and prefix_check_twosfx_morph()).
          Bug reported by Trón Viktor.
        
        * src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: complete also *_morph() functions with
          conditions of new Hunspell features (circumfix, pseudoroot etc.).

        * src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx:
        - fix missing suggestions for words with crossed prefix and suffix
        - fix redundant non compound word checking
        - fix losing suggestions problem. Bug reported by Dmitri Gabinski.

        * src/hunspell/dictmgr.*:
        - add new dictionary manager for Hunspell UNO modul
          Problems with eo_ANY Esperanto locale reported by Dmitri Gabinski.

	* src/hunspell/*: use precise constant sizes for 8-bit and 16-bit character
          arrays with MAXWORDUTF8LEN and MAXSWUTF8L macros.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: fix bad MAXNGRAMSUGS parameter handling

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx, src/tools/{un}munch.*: fix GCC 4.0 warnings
          on fgets(), reported by Dvornik László

	* po/hu.po: improved translation by Dvornik László

        * tests/test.sh: improved test environment
        - add suggestion testing (see tests/*.sug)
        - add memory debugging environment, based on the excellent Valgrind debugger.
          Usage on Linux and experimental platforms of Valgrind:
          VALGRIND=memcheck make check
        - rename test_hunmorph to test.sh

        * tests/*: new tests:
        - base.*: base example based on MySpell's checkme.lst.
        - map{,utf}.*, rep{,utf}: MAP and REP suggestion examples
        - tests on new CHECKCOMPOUND, ONLYINCOMPOUND and PSEUDOROOT features
        - i54633.*: capitalized suggestion test for Issue 54633 from OOo's Issuezilla
        - i35725.*: improved ngram suggestion test for Issue 35725

2005-08-26 Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu>:
improvements:

	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx:
	  Unicode support in related character map suggestion
	
	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx: Unicode support in ngram suggestion

	* src/hunspell/{suggestmgr,affixmgr,hunspell}.cxx: improve ngram suggestion.
	  Fix http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=35725. See release
          notes for examples. This problem reported by beccablain at OOo.
        - ngram suggestions now are case insensitive (see `Permenant' bug in Issuezilla)
        - weight ngram suggestions (with the longest common subsequent algorithm,
          also considering lengths of bad word and suggestion, identical first
          letters and almost completely identical character positions)
        - set strict affix congruency in expand_rootword(). Now ngram suggestions
          are good for languages with rich morphology and also better for English.
          Rationale: affixed forms of the first ngram suggestion
          very often suppress the second and subsequent root word suggestions. But
          faults in affixes are more uncommon, and can be fix without suggestions.
          We must prefer the more informative second and subsequent root word
          suggestions instead of the suggestions for bad affixes.
        - a better suggestion may not be substring of a less good suggestion
	  Rationale: Suggesting affixed forms of a root word is
          unnecessary, when root word has got better weighted ngram value.
          (Checking substrings is a good approximation for this refinement.)
	- lesser ngram suggestions (default 3 maximum instead of 10)
          Rationale: For users need a big extra effort to check a lot of bad ngram
          suggestions, nine times out of ten unnecessarily. It is very
          distracting, because ngram suggestions could be very different.
          Usually Myspell and Hunspell suggest one or two suggestions with
          the old suggestion algorithms (maximum is 15), with ngram algorithm
          often gives maximum number suggestions. With strict affix congruency
          and other refinements, the good suggestion there is usually among the
          first three elements.
	- new affix parameter: MAXNGRAMSUG

        * src/hunspell/*: support agglutinative languages with rich prefix
	  morphology or with right-to-left writing system (for example, Turkic
	  and Austronesian languages with (modified) Arabic scripts).
	- new affix parameter: COMPLEXPREFIXES
	  Set twofold prefix stripping (but single suffix stripping)
	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx:
	- speed up prefix loading with tree sorting algorithm.
	* tests/complexprefixes.*, tests/complexprefixesutf.*:
	  Coptic example posted by Moheb Mekhaiel

	* src/hunspell/hashmgr.cxx: check size attribute in dic file
	  suggested by Daniel Naber
	  Rationale: With missing size attribute Hunspell allocates too small and
          more slower hash memory, and Hunspell can lose first dictionary word.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: check stripping characters and condition
	  compatibility in affix rules (bugs detected in cs_CZ, es_ES, es_NEW,
          es_MX, lt_LT, nn_NO, pt_PT, ro_RO and sk_SK dictionaries). See release
          notes of Hunspell 1.0.9 in NEWS.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: check unnecessary fields in affix rules
          (bugs detected in ro_RO and sv_SE dictionaries). See release notes.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: remove redundant condition checking
	  in affix rules with stripping characters (redundancy in OpenOffice.org
	  dictionaries reported by Eleonóra Goldman)
          Rationale: this is a little optimization, but it was excellent for
          detect the bad ngram affixation with bad or weak affix conditions.

	* tests/germancompounding.aff: improve compound definition
	- use dash prefix instead of language specific tokenizer
          Rationale: Using uniform approach is the right way to check and analyze
	  compound words. Language specific word breaking is deprecated, need
          a sophisticated grammar checking for word-like word pairs
          (for example in Hungarian there is a substandard, but accepted
          syntax with dash for word pairs: cats, dogs -> kutyák-macskák (like
          cats/dogs in English).

	* test Hunspell with 54 OpenOffice.org dictionaries: see release notes

bug fixes:

	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.*: add time limit to exponential
	  algorithm of the related character map suggestion
	  Rationale: a long word in agglutinative languages or a special pattern
          (for example a horizontal rule) made of map characters can `crash' the
          spell checker.

        * src/hunspell/affentry.cxx: add() functions: fix bad word generation
          checking stripping characters (see similar bug in unmunch)

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: parse_file(): fix unconditional getNext()
	  call for ~AffixMgr() when affix file is corrupt.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: AffixMgr(), parse_cpdsyllable(): fix missing
	  string duplications for ~AffixMgr() when affix file is corrupt.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: parse_affix(): fix fprintf() call when affix
	  file is corrupt. Bug reported by Daniel Naber.

	* suggestmgr.cxx: replace single usage of 'strdup' with 'mystrdup'
	  patch by Chris Halls (debian.org)

	* src/hunspell/makefile.mk: add makefile.mk for compiling in OpenOffice.org
	  See README in Hunspell UNO modul.
	  Problems with separated compiling reported by Rene Engelhard

	* src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: fix pseudoroot support
	- search a not pseudoroot homonym in check()
	* tests/pseudoroot4.*: test this fix

	* src/tools/unmunch.c: fix bad word generation when conditions
	  are shorter or incompatible with stripping characters in affix rules

	* src/tools/unmunch.c: fix mychomp() for de_AT.dic and other dic files
	  without last new line character.

other changes:
	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.*: erase ACCENT suggestion
	  Rationale: ACCENT suggestion was the same as Kevin Hendrick's map
	  suggestion algorithm, but with a less good interface in affix file.

	* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.*: combine cycle number limit
	  in badchar(), and forgotchar() with a time limit.

	* src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: remove NOMAPSUGS affix parameter

	* src/hunspell/{suggestmgr,hunspell}.*: strip periods from
	  suggestions (restore MySpell's original behaviour)
	  Rationale: OpenOffice.org has an automatic period handling mechanism
	  and suggestions look better without periods.
	- new affix file parameter: SUGSWITHDOTS
	  Add period(s) to suggestions, if input word terminates in period(s).
          (No need for OpenOffice.org dictionaries.)

	* tests/germancompounding.aff: improve bad german affix in affix example
	  (computeren->computern). Suggested by Daniel Naber.

	* src/tools/example.cxx: add Myspell's example
