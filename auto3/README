Automation 3 support in Automation 4 needs to be built as a separate library,
to be able to have two versions of Lua side by side. This is required since
Automation 3, and especially scripts written for it, relies on the Lua 5.0
API.


Compiling on Windows
--------------------
If you are building on Windows, be aware that Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
(version 8) CAN NOT COMPILE LUA 5.0 CORRECTLY. While the build will succeed,
the built binaries are broken and do not work correctly.

You need to use Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 (version 7.1) to build the
Windows version of this library. Other compilers might also work.

You should not need to build this DLL yourself even if you are building
Aegisub; just get one built on someone else. Unless, of course, you want to
hack the Auto3 code.
