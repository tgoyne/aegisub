This directory contains a version of Lua 5.1 patched specifically for use
with Aegisub. You *MUST* use this version of Lua when building Aegisub.

Patches include, currently:
- loadlib.c: The Win32 DLL loading code now assumes all strings are UTF-8
  encoded, and uses the wide-char versions of the API functions.
- lmathlib.c: Removed the value math.huge, due to linker problems. (This
  value will probably be re-introduced if anyone can provide a good
  solution to the problem ;)

Planned patches:
- lstrlib.c: Make all functions assume input is UTF-8, and make string
  handling seem as if strings were UTF-32.
- lzio.c: Ignore any UTF-8 BOM that happens to be at the beginning of
  a file. Idea: Maybe also make it read UTF-16 files, if BOM is present?
- lbaselib.c: Maybe remove dofile and loadfile functions entirely; not
  entirely sure about this.

Note that Lua no longer compiles as ANSI C, but must be compiled as C++.
This should probably be fixed.
