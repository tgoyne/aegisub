Template Based B+ Tree Implementation
=====================================

Description
-----------

B+ Tree is a type of tree, which represents sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, 
retrieval and removal of records, each of which is identified by a key. 
It is a dynamic, multilevel index, with maximum and minimum bounds on the number of keys in each index 
segment (usually called a 'block' or 'node'). In a B+ tree, in contrast to a B-tree, 
all records are stored at the lowest level of the tree; only keys are stored in interior blocks.
