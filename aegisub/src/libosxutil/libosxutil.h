/** @file libosxutil.h
 * @brief OSX utilities
 *
 * Utility functions for running regular *NIX libraries inside application
 * bundles on Apple Macintosh OS X.
 *
 * The GetBundle*Directory functions return the paths of directories inside
 * the appliaction bundle where the application can store static data and
 * shared libraries for its own use.
 * (The bundle and its contents should be considered read-only.)
 *
 * When linking with this library, be sure to add '-framework CoreFoundation'
 * to the GCC commandline.

 * @note All strings returned by these functions are allocated by strdup(), it is
 * the responsibility of the caller to free() them.
 * All of the functions may return NULL on error.
