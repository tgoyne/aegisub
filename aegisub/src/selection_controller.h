/// @class SelectionController
/// @brief Abstract interface for selection controllers
///
/// Two concepts are managed by implementations of this interface: The concept of the
/// active line, and the concept of the set of selected lines. There is one or zero
/// active lines, the active line is the base for subtitle manipulation in the GUI.
/// The set of selected lines may contain any number of subtitle lines, and those
/// lines are the primary target of subtitle manipulation. In other words, the active
/// line controls what values the user is presented to modify, and the selected set
/// controls what lines are actually modified when the user performs modifications.
/// In most cases, the active line will be a member of the selected set. It will be
/// the responsibility of manipulators to affect the appropriate lines.
///
/// There is only intended to be one instance of a class implementing this interface
/// per editing session, but there may be many different implementations of it.
/// The primary implementation would be the subtitle grid in the main GUI, allowing
/// the user to actively manipulate the active and selected line sets, but other
/// potential implementations are in a test driver and in a non-interactive scenario.
///
/// Objects implementing the SelectionListener interface can subscribe to
/// changes in the active line and the selected set.
