Aegisub Automation 4 branch build
Alpha-quality

Please install in a folder separate from your main Aegisub installation.

What works:
- UI-wise:
  o Scanning the automation/autoload/ dir for scripts and loading them
  o Rescanning said dir
  o Macros not in right-click menu
  o Reloading scripts on command
  o Adding arbitrary other scripts to the local-scripts list (ie. bound to
    subtitles rather than the application)
  o Storing locally loaded scripts into subtiles on save
  o Restoring locally loaded scripts from subtitle file on load
  o Graceful recovery from (most) errors
  o Scripts with errors are not retained, but marked as "has errors"
  o Nice presentation of script debug-output
- Scripting-wise
  o Global script info variables are read
  o Macros:
    # Registration function
	# Processing function
	# Validation function
	# Config dialogs
  o Export filters:
    # Registration function
	# Processing function
  o Basic subtitle manipulation:
    # Getting subtitle data from a line
	# Storing subtitle data back into a line
	# Appending lines to script
	# Inserting lines at random positions in the script
	# Deleting lines and (UNTESTED) ranges of lines
	# All of the above needs more testing
  o Setting undo-points
  o Table of selected lines is correctly filled
  o Parsing karaoke tags
  o Modifying subtitles/setting undo points *should* be impossible in
    Validation functions
  o text_extents (currently identical to Auto3 version, meaning it also has
    the same strange inaccuracies)
  o include() function
  o Making debug-output

What's broken:
- UI-wise:
  o No support for right-click menu macros
  o Macro appearance in menus doesn't look too nice (needs a separator before
    the macros)
  o All functions in the program (including stuff unrelated to Automation)
    should mark what kind of operation is put into the undo/redo buffer, but
	this seems to be lost somewhere and isn't properly displayed.
- Scripting-wise
  o active_line parameter to macro validation and processing functions seems
    to not be filled correctly
  o Lua needs a string library for processing UTF-8 strings natively, as well
    as a regex library for working with Unicode strings. Perhaps even
	introduce a new userdata type for storing widestrings?
  o Stored options for export script config dialogs aren't supported yet.

What's missing:
- UI wise:
  o Apart from things relying on other Features being implemented in
    scripting, nothing I can think of.
- Scripting-wise:
  o Override (un)parsing of tags
  o Subtitle Format reader/writer features
  o File streams (required for subtitle format features)

Things to try:
- Test, test, TEST!
  Write some scripts that do more or less useful things.
  Try to break stuff.
  Report bugs.
- Config dialogs definately need more testing, whether all controls
  behave sensibly etc.
