This directory contains various Aegisub Automation scripts provided for demonstration
purposes. Most of these were originally written for testing the various functions
in Automation durings its development, but they hopefully can also serve as good
places to learn how to do things.
All of these scripts are written by Niels Martin Hansen.

They are given into the public domain, but if you use a substantial part of any of
the more advanced ones, I'd really like a bit of credit where it's due.

And remember, it's cheap to use someone else's advanced karaoke effect, especially
without any changes at all. It also gives bad karma. Like, *really* bad :)

Apart from just the .lua files, there's also a few .ass files, used for eg. showing
how some special feature is implemented in the ASS itself. It should be obvious
what .lua and .ass files are related.


WARNING!
DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN FILES TO THIS DIRECTORY,
they will be deleted when you uninstall/upgrade Aegisub.
This also means it's unwise to modify these files, if you want to keep your
changes to them.
