## Building Aegisub

### Windows

Prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 or older (Express edition is good enough; Update 3 is not supported) or the Windows 8.1 SDK (command line builds only).
2. A recent DirectX SDK
4. [Yasm](http://yasm.tortall.net/) installed to somewhere on your path.

There are a few optional dependencies:

1. msgfmt, to build the translations
2. WinRAR, to build the portable installer
3. InnoSetup, to build the regular installer

All other dependencies are either stored in the repository or are included as submodules.

Building:

1. Clone Aegisub's repository recursively to fetch it and all submodules: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Aegisub/Aegisub.git`
2. Open Aegisub.sln
3. Build the solution.
4. Copy the contents of an existing Aegisub install into the aegisub/aegisub/bin directory (not strictly required, but you'll be missing a lot of functionality otherwise).

For actual development work you will probably want to mostly use the
"Debug-MinDep" configuration (which disables building most of the projects), as
the dependency checking is pretty slow.
