## Building Aegisub

### Windows

Prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio 2012. Express edition might work.
2. A recent Windows SDK
3. A recent DirectX SDK
4. A MSYS install with git and c99conv. Note that mingw is not required.

There are a few optional dependencies:

1. msgfmt, to build the translations
2. WinRAR, to build the portable installer
3. InnoSetup, to build the regular installer

All other dependencies are either stored in the repository or are included as submodules.

Building:

1. Clone Aegisub's repository recursively to fetch it and all submodules: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Aegisub/Aegisub.git`
2. Disable autocrlf for ffmpeg, as its build system manages to not support Windows newlines: `cd aegisub/deps/ffmpeg && config --local core.autocrlf && git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard`
3. Open Aegisub.sln
4. Build the "! Update Dependencies" project
5. Open the properties for the Aegisub project and set the location of MSYS in Configuration Properties > Aegisub > Library paths
6. Build Aegisub
7. Copy the contents of an existing Aegisub install into the aegisub/aegisub/bin directory (not strictly required, but you'll be missing a lot of functionality otherwise).

There's a pile of other files such as dictionaries, VSFilter and avisynth 

For actual development work you will probably want to mostly use the
"Debug-MinDep" configuration (which disables building most of the projects), as
the dependency checking is pretty slow.
