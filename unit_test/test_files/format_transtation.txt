We've got visual confirmation.
I'm putting it on the main screen.

SUB[0 N 00:03:24:08>00:03:26:03]
It's been fifteen years, hasn't it?

SUB[0 N 00:03:26:05>00:03:28:08]
Yes, there's no doubt.

SUB[0 N 00:03:29:08>00:03:30:15]
It's an Angel.

Episode One
Angel Attack

SUB[0 N 00:03:42:14>00:03:44:09]
Every missile hit the target!

SUB[0 N 00:04:03:15>00:04:05:03]
I'm sorry! Thanks for waiting!

SUB[0 N 00:04:22:03>00:04:26:20]
The target is still operational.
It's still heading towards New Tokyo-3.

SUB[0 N 00:04:26:23>00:04:29:08]
The Air Defense Force doesn't have
the firepower to stop it!

SUB[0 N 00:04:30:03>00:04:31:08]
Hit it with everything we've got!

SUB[0 N 00:04:31:08>00:04:33:07]
Mobilize all of Atsugi and Iruma as well!

SUB[0 N 00:04:33:09>00:04:36:21]
Don't hold anything back!
Destroy the target at any cost!

SUB[0 N 00:04:50:01>00:04:52:04]
Why?! That was a direct hit!

SUB[0 N 00:04:52:19>00:04:55:00]
The tank battalion's been annihilated.

SUB[0 N 00:04:55:01>00:04:57:28]
Guided missiles and artillery
have no effect either.

SUB[0 N 00:04:57:29>00:05:01:15]
It's no good! We'll never get anywhere
with the firepower we've got!

Is it an AT field after all?

SUB[0 N 00:05:03:11>00:05:04:15]
Yes. Conventional weapons are
useless against Angels.

I understand. We'll activate it as planned.

Hey, don't tell me...

SUB[0 N 00:05:20:11>00:05:22:06]
They're going to use an N² mine?!

SUB[0 N 00:05:22:22>00:05:23:22]
Get down!

SUB[0 N 00:05:46:16>00:05:47:12]
We did it!

SUB[0 N 00:05:48:23>00:05:51:26]
Sorry, but it looks like you won't be
getting a shot at it.

SUB[0 N 00:05:51:29>00:05:54:04]
Shock wave approaching.

SUB[0 N 00:05:55:11>00:05:56:20]
Are you all right?

SUB[0 N 00:05:56:23>00:06:00:02]
Yeah, but my mouth is full of dirt.

SUB[0 N 00:06:00:03>00:06:04:01]
That's okay. Now then, here we go!

SUB[0 N 00:06:04:22>00:06:06:01]
One, two!

SUB[0 N 00:06:09:26>00:06:11:12]
There.

SUB[0 N 00:06:14:23>00:06:16:25]
Thanks for the hand. I really appreciate it.

SUB[0 N 00:06:16:28>00:06:19:27]
Thank you too, Katsuragi-san.

SUB[0 N 00:06:20:00>00:06:22:02]
Just Misato is fine.

SUB[0 N 00:06:22:16>00:06:25:26]
I'm glad we've met at last, Ikari Shinji-kun.

SUB[0 N 00:06:26:05>00:06:27:00]
Yeah...

SUB[0 N 00:06:27:17>00:06:28:24]
What's the target's status?

SUB[0 N 00:06:28:26>00:06:31:23]
We're unable to confirm due to
all the EMP interference.

SUB[0 N 00:06:31:26>00:06:34:18]
You saw the size of the explosion. It's over.

SUB[0 N 00:06:34:21>00:06:36:03]
Sensors restored.

SUB[0 N 00:06:37:13>00:06:39:07]
We've got an energy reading
at the explosion's epicenter!

SUB[0 N 00:06:39:10>00:06:40:13]
What the hell?!

SUB[0 N 00:06:40:16>00:06:42:04]
Visual display restored.

SUB[0 N 00:06:46:13>00:06:48:19]
That was our last resort.

SUB[0 N 00:06:49:18>00:06:51:15]
How can this be?

SUB[0 N 00:06:51:15>00:06:53:04]
Damned monster!

SUB[0 N 00:07:03:02>00:07:05:14]
Yes. Don't worry about it.

SUB[0 N 00:07:05:17>00:07:09:18]
His safety is my top priority,
so could you get a car train ready for us?

SUB[0 N 00:07:09:21>00:07:10:27]
A direct one.

SUB[0 N 00:07:11:24>00:07:12:22]
Right.

SUB[0 N 00:07:13:04>00:07:15:13]
Well, I volunteered to pick him up,

SUB[0 N 00:07:15:14>00:07:18:04]
so I'll make sure he gets there. See ya!

SUB[0 N 00:07:20:15>00:07:26:27]
Man, this sucks! I just had my car restored
and it's a total wreck already!

SUB[0 N 00:07:27:13>00:07:30:16]
33 more loan payments to go,
plus the cost of repairs.

SUB[0 N 00:07:30:18>00:07:32:28]
And look! My best dress has been ruined!

SUB[0 N 00:07:32:29>00:07:33:04]
Excuse me, Misato-san?
And look! My best dress has been ruined!

SUB[0 N 00:07:33:04>00:07:33:15]
Excuse me, Misato-san?

SUB[0 N 00:07:33:16>00:07:34:23]
And I was looking and feeling so nice.
Excuse me, Misato-san?

SUB[0 N 00:07:34:23>00:07:37:08]

SUB[0 N 00:07:37:08>00:07:38:28]
Excuse me, Misato-san?

SUB[0 N 00:07:39:05>00:07:40:19]
What?

SUB[0 N 00:07:40:22>00:07:43:11]
Are you sure you can just take those?

SUB[0 N 00:07:45:07>00:07:46:05]
Never mind about that!

SUB[0 N 00:07:46:08>00:07:50:01]
It's an emergency, and we need
a working car right now, right?

SUB[0 N 00:07:50:03>00:07:53:17]
And I'm an international government
official, after all,

SUB[0 N 00:07:53:20>00:07:55:07]
so everything's going to be
perfectly fine, okay?

SUB[0 N 00:07:56:19>00:07:59:08]
I don't think anyone will buy that.

SUB[0 N 00:07:59:10>00:08:03:13]
You're no fun. You look cute,
but you're kind of a cold fish.

SUB[0 N 00:08:04:11>00:08:05:21]
You think so?

SUB[0 N 00:08:05:23>00:08:07:15]
Oh, did I upset you?

SUB[0 N 00:08:08:08>00:08:11:19]
Sorry about that! You are a boy, after all.

SUB[0 N 00:08:11:22>00:08:15:00]
And you're pretty childish for your age.

SUB[0 N 00:08:20:22>00:08:23:19]
As we predicted, it's regenerating itself.

SUB[0 N 00:08:23:29>00:08:27:24]
If it couldn't, it wouldn't be
a practical autonomous weapon.

SUB[0 N 00:08:31:14>00:08:35:02]
Impressive. It appears it can even upgrade
its own operational functions.

SUB[0 N 00:08:35:12>00:08:37:20]
And it seems to have gotten smarter.

SUB[0 N 00:08:38:21>00:08:41:18]
It's only a matter of time before
it resumes attacking.

SUB[9 N 00:08:43:01>00:08:46:08]

From this point forward, command of this
operation will be entrusted to you.

SUB[0 N 00:09:10:26>00:09:12:15]
Show us what you're capable of.

SUB[0 N 00:09:12:17>00:09:13:20]
Yes, Sir.

SUB[0 N 00:09:14:08>00:09:20:10]
Ikari-kun, we will admit that our weapons
have no effect on the target.

SUB[0 N 00:09:21:08>00:09:23:19]
But are you sure you can beat this thing?

SUB[0 N 00:09:24:04>00:09:25:24]
It's what Nerv was created for.

SUB[0 N 00:09:26:19>00:09:28:03]
Let's hope you're correct.

SUB[0 N 00:09:29:23>00:09:31:26]
The target is still stationary.

SUB[0 N 00:09:31:29>00:09:35:10]
Our intercept system is currently
7.5% operational.

SUB[0 N 00:09:37:00>00:09:39:10]
So, even the UN forces have retired.

SUB[0 N 00:09:39:12>00:09:41:00]
What are you going to do?

SUB[0 N 00:09:41:15>00:09:43:15]
I intend to activate Unit 01.

SUB[0 N 00:09:43:23>00:09:46:25]
Unit 01? But we have no pilot.

SUB[0 N 00:09:47:14>00:09:51:02]
That's not a problem. Another spare
will be delivered soon.

SUB[0 N 00:09:52:02>00:09:54:23]
Are you taking me to my father?

SUB[0 N 00:09:55:09>00:09:57:11]
Yes. Pretty much.

SUB[0 N 00:10:01:07>00:10:02:14]
Father...

SUB[0 N 00:10:04:02>00:10:07:13]
Oh, that's right. Did you get
an ID card from your father?

SUB[0 N 00:10:09:10>00:10:10:10]
Yes.

SUB[0 N 00:10:12:00>00:10:13:01]
Here it is.

SUB[0 N 00:10:13:03>00:10:13:25]

Am I going to work for them too?

SUB[0 N 00:10:27:00>00:10:28:14]
Of course.

SUB[0 N 00:10:28:20>00:10:32:23]
He wouldn't have sent me a letter unless
he needed me for something.

SUB[0 N 00:10:33:08>00:10:36:06]
I see. So you don't get along with your father.

SUB[0 N 00:10:37:19>00:10:39:06]
It's the same with me.

SUB[0 N 00:10:45:06>00:10:46:14]
Awesome!

SUB[0 N 00:10:47:20>00:10:49:11]

to be used, you know.

SUB[9 N 00:11:29:07>00:11:31:28]
Would the head of Project E,
Technical Department Division 1,

SUB[9 N 00:11:31:29>00:11:34:24]
Dr. Akagi Ritsuko, Dr. Akagi Ritsuko,

SUB[9 N 00:11:34:25>00:11:39:13]
please contact Captain Katsuragi Misato
of Operations, Division 1, immediately.

SUB[0 N 00:11:39:18>00:11:41:13]
I don't believe it.

SUB[0 N 00:11:41:13>00:11:42:12]
She got lost again, didn't she?

SUB[0 N 00:11:46:26>00:11:48:27]
Uh, hiya, Ritsuko.

SUB[0 N 00:11:53:18>00:11:55:29]
What were you doing, Captain Katsuragi?

SUB[0 N 00:11:56:02>00:11:58:09]
We're short on both time
and manpower, you know.

SUB[0 N 00:11:58:24>00:11:59:25]
Sorry!

SUB[0 N 00:12:03:04>00:12:04:28]
So this is the boy?

SUB[0 N 00:12:05:01>00:12:08:28]
Right. According to the Marduk report,
he's the "Third Child".

SUB[0 N 00:12:09:20>00:12:10:22]
I'm glad to meet you.

SUB[0 N 00:12:10:25>00:12:12:19]
Huh? Sure.

SUB[0 N 00:12:13:00>00:12:17:25]
He's just like his father.
Like how he's unendearing.

SUB[0 N 00:12:18:07>00:12:19:14]
I'll leave the rest to you.

SUB[0 N 00:12:23:28>00:12:26:05]
Their first meeting in over three years.

SUB[0 N 00:12:27:06>00:12:30:26]
Vice Commander, the target
has started moving again.

SUB[0 N 00:12:30:29>00:12:34:10]
Right. All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

SUB[9 N 00:12:34:16>00:12:37:26]
Repeat. All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

SUB[9 N 00:12:37:27>00:12:39:08]
Prepare for ground-unit interception.

SUB[0 N 00:12:39:24>00:12:41:00]
Here we go.

SUB[0 N 00:12:41:01>00:12:42:07]
It sounds pretty serious.

SUB[0 N 00:12:43:12>00:12:45:16]
So, how's Unit 01 doing?

SUB[0 N 00:12:45:17>00:12:47:27]
It's currently in refrigeration,
using the B-type equipment.

SUB[0 N 00:12:47:28>00:12:51:27]
Does it really work?
It's never worked before, right?

SUB[0 N 00:12:51:28>00:12:56:26]
The possibility of activation is 0.000000001%.

SUB[0 N 00:12:57:14>00:12:59:29]
We call it, pathetically enough,
the O-9 System.

SUB[0 N 00:12:59:29>00:13:02:19]
Does that mean it doesn't work?

SUB[0 N 00:13:02:19>00:13:05:03]
Oh, don't be insulting. It's not zero.

SUB[0 N 00:13:05:03>00:13:06:24]
Well, it's just a number.

SUB[0 N 00:13:06:26>00:13:11:12]
Anyway, it's a bit too late to be saying,
"Sorry, it didn't work".

SUB[0 N 00:13:20:01>00:13:22:23]
Huh? It's completely dark.

SUB[0 N 00:13:26:11>00:13:29:04]
A face? A giant robot?

SUB[0 N 00:13:30:25>00:13:33:00]
You won't find this in the manual.

SUB[0 N 00:13:34:04>00:13:38:03]
This is mankind's ultimate
multipurpose decisive weapon,

SUB[0 N 00:13:38:03>00:13:42:00]
the synthetic human Evangelion, Unit 01.

SUB[0 N 00:13:42:01>00:13:47:07]
Built in absolute secrecy,
it is mankind's trump card.

SUB[0 N 00:13:47:08>00:13:49:07]
Is this part of what my father's been doing?

SUB[0 N 00:13:49:08>00:13:50:04]
Correct.

SUB[0 N 00:13:52:04>00:13:53:13]
It's been a while.

SUB[0 N 00:13:54:16>00:13:55:19]
Father...

SUB[0 N 00:13:58:22>00:13:59:15]
We're moving out!

SUB[0 N 00:14:00:00>00:14:03:13]
Moving out?! Unit 00's still in
cryo-stasis, isn't it?

SUB[0 N 00:14:05:12>00:14:07:18]
You're not planning to use Unit 01?!

SUB[0 N 00:14:08:12>00:14:09:28]
There's no other way.

SUB[0 N 00:14:09:28>00:14:12:24]
Hold on! Rei can't do it yet, can she?

SUB[0 N 00:14:13:23>00:14:15:04]
We've got no pilot!

SUB[0 N 00:14:16:02>00:14:17:07]
A pilot has just been delivered.

SUB[0 N 00:14:18:16>00:14:19:16]
Are you serious?

SUB[0 N 00:14:20:16>00:14:21:17]
Ikari Shinji-kun...

SUB[0 N 00:14:21:18>00:14:22:20]
Yes?

SUB[0 N 00:14:22:21>00:14:23:21]
You will pilot it.

SUB[0 N 00:14:24:13>00:14:29:12]
But even Ayanami Rei took seven months
to synchronize with her Eva.

SUB[0 N 00:14:29:18>00:14:32:07]
It's impossible for him to do it!
He just got here!

SUB[0 N 00:14:32:09>00:14:35:03]
He just has to sit in the seat.
We don't expect more than that.

SUB[0 N 00:14:35:05>00:14:36:04]
But...

SUB[0 N 00:14:36:07>00:14:38:27]
Repelling that Angel is our ultimate priority.

SUB[0 N 00:14:39:12>00:14:43:00]
To do that, we have no choice but to put
aboard the Eva whomever has the chance

SUB[0 N 00:14:43:02>00:14:45:18]
to synchronize with it, no matter how slight.

SUB[0 N 00:14:46:26>00:14:48:23]
I believe you know that, Captain Katsuragi.

SUB[0 N 00:14:51:08>00:14:52:17]
I suppose...

SUB[0 N 00:14:54:06>00:14:56:17]
Father, why did you send for me?

SUB[0 N 00:14:56:18>00:14:58:21]
You know exactly why.

SUB[0 N 00:14:58:22>00:15:02:19]
So, you're asking me to take this thing
and fight that thing?

SUB[0 N 00:15:03:10>00:15:04:10]
That's right.

SUB[0 N 00:15:04:10>00:15:08:00]
No way! Why are you doing this now?!

SUB[0 N 00:15:08:00>00:15:10:18]
I thought you didn't need me!

SUB[0 N 00:15:10:18>00:15:12:24]
I called you because I have a need for you.

SUB[0 N 00:15:15:11>00:15:16:24]
Why me?

SUB[0 N 00:15:17:14>00:15:19:20]
Because no one else can.

SUB[0 N 00:15:20:11>00:15:22:01]
No, I can't...

SUB[0 N 00:15:22:14>00:15:26:00]
I've never even seen anything
like this before! I can't do this!

SUB[0 N 00:15:27:00>00:15:28:11]
You will be instructed.

SUB[0 N 00:15:29:01>00:15:32:25]
But there's no way I can do this!

SUB[0 N 00:15:33:21>00:15:35:21]
I can't pilot it!

SUB[0 N 00:15:37:06>00:15:40:06]
If you're going to pilot it, do it now
and quickly. If not, leave!

SUB[0 N 00:15:51:27>00:15:54:13]
It must have detected our location.

SUB[0 N 00:15:58:03>00:16:00:00]
Shinji-kun, we don't have time.

SUB[0 N 00:16:05:02>00:16:06:06]
Get into it.

SUB[0 N 00:16:07:09>00:16:11:28]
No! I didn't come for this! This isn't fair!

SUB[0 N 00:16:13:07>00:16:16:20]
Shinji-kun, just why did you come here?

SUB[0 N 00:16:18:17>00:16:22:20]
You mustn't run! Not from your father,
and most of all not from yourself.

SUB[0 N 00:16:23:09>00:16:27:11]
I know that! But there's no way I can do it!

SUB[0 N 00:16:35:16>00:16:36:15]
Fuyutsuki...

SUB[0 N 00:16:37:25>00:16:39:07]
Wake up Rei.

SUB[0 N 00:16:39:07>00:16:40:21]
Can we use her?

SUB[0 N 00:16:40:22>00:16:42:08]
She isn't dead.

SUB[0 N 00:16:43:13>00:16:44:16]
I understand.

SUB[0 N 00:16:46:11>00:16:47:07]
Rei.

SUB[0 N 00:16:47:07>00:16:48:11]
Yes?

SUB[0 N 00:16:48:11>00:16:51:07]
Our spare is unusable. You will do it again.

SUB[0 N 00:16:51:07>00:16:52:06]
Yes, Sir.

SUB[0 N 00:16:54:14>00:16:57:27]
Reconfigure Unit 01's system to Rei,
then re-activate!

SUB[0 N 00:16:57:27>00:17:00:29]
Roger. Call off the present work,
and begin re-activation.

SUB[0 N 00:17:02:29>00:17:06:23]
I knew it. I'm not needed after all.

SUB[0 N 00:17:40:20>00:17:41:20]
Watch out!

SUB[0 N 00:17:51:09>00:17:52:26]
The Eva moved!

SUB[0 N 00:17:52:26>00:17:54:02]
What's going on?!

SUB[0 N 00:17:54:02>00:17:56:13]
It broke the right arm restraint!

SUB[0 N 00:17:56:13>00:17:58:00]
No, that's impossible!

SUB[0 N 00:17:58:15>00:18:00:21]
It didn't even have an entry plug inserted!

SUB[0 N 00:18:00:21>00:18:01:28]
There's no way it could have moved!

SUB[0 N 00:18:03:02>00:18:05:09]
It reacted without any interface?!

SUB[0 N 00:18:06:03>00:18:08:05]
Or was it protecting...

SUB[0 N 00:18:08:05>00:18:09:06]
him?

SUB[0 N 00:18:10:16>00:18:11:15]
We can do it.

SUB[0 N 00:18:32:16>00:18:37:04]
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

SUB[0 N 00:18:37:04>00:18:38:09]
I mustn't run away!

SUB[0 N 00:18:39:23>00:18:40:19]
I'll do it.

SUB[0 N 00:18:41:11>00:18:42:14]
I'll pilot it!

SUB[0 N 00:18:46:01>00:18:47:09]
Cooling process, completed.

SUB[0 N 00:18:47:10>00:18:48:25]
Right arm re-secured.

SUB[0 N 00:18:48:26>00:18:50:26]
Cage contents now in position for docking.

SUB[0 N 00:18:50:27>00:18:51:24]
Roger.

SUB[0 N 00:18:51:25>00:18:54:19]
Signal terminator plug has been ejected.

SUB[0 N 00:18:55:06>00:18:57:24]

Filling the entry plug.

SUB[0 N 00:19:16:02>00:19:17:13]
What is this stuff?

SUB[0 N 00:19:21:12>00:19:24:13]
Don't worry. Once your lungs
are filled with LCL,

SUB[0 N 00:19:24:13>00:19:27:05]
your blood will be oxygenated directly.

SUB[0 N 00:19:27:06>00:19:28:16]
You'll get used to it.

SUB[0 N 00:19:32:00>00:19:33:13]
I feel nauseous.

SUB[0 N 00:19:33:13>00:19:35:21]
Stop whining! You're a boy, aren't you?!

SUB[0 N 00:19:37:00>00:19:38:04]
Connecting main power.

SUB[0 N 00:19:38:04>00:19:40:25]

All preliminary contacts established.
Performance nominal.

SUB[0 N 00:19:55:26>00:19:57:19]
Bi-directional circuits are open.

SUB[0 N 00:19:58:06>00:20:00:21]
Synchronization rate at 41.3%.

SUB[0 N 00:20:01:11>00:20:02:18]
Amazing.

SUB[0 N 00:20:02:18>00:20:06:05]
Harmonics are all normal.
No disturbances identified.

SUB[0 N 00:20:06:29>00:20:07:29]
We can do it.

SUB[0 N 00:20:09:11>00:20:10:18]

Roger.

SUB[0 N 00:21:10:00>00:21:11:03]
Can we really do this?

SUB[0 N 00:21:11:03>00:21:12:04]
Of course.

SUB[0 N 00:21:13:01>00:21:15:17]
Unless we defeat the Angels,
we have no future.

SUB[0 N 00:21:17:05>00:21:20:04]
Ikari, you're really sure about this?

SUB[0 N 00:21:21:24>00:21:22:23]
Launch!

SUB[0 N 00:21:56:22>00:21:58:24]
