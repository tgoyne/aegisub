The year is 2015 A.D.

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,030
As of 12:30 PM today, a special state
of emergency has been declared

3
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,260
for the Kanto and Chubu regions
surrounding the Tokai district.

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,800
All residents must evacuate to their
designated shelters immediately.

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,310
have been declared to be under
a state of emergency.

10
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,920
All residents must evacuate...

11
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,390
Why did I have to lose sight of him now?

12
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,110
Oh, man!

13
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,230
Ikari Shinji
Oh, man!

14
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,260
Ikari Shinji

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,750
Due to the special emergency,
Ikari Shinji

16
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,960
Due to the special emergency,

17
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,300
all lines are currently unavailable.

18
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,730
It's no use.

19
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,070
I shouldn't have come here after all.

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,380
for me.♥
Attention here!!
I'll be coming to
get you, so wait
To Shinji-kun

21
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,260
Well, I guess we won't be meeting here.
for me.♥

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,740
Well, I guess we won't be meeting here.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,480
Can't be helped. I'll go to a shelter.

24

ESTIMATED PATH

25
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,550
The unidentified mobile object is still
advancing on our position.
ESTIMATED PATH

26
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,600
The unidentified mobile object is still
advancing on our position.

27
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,610
We've got visual confirmation.
I'm putting it on the main screen.

28
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,120
It's been fifteen years, hasn't it?

29
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,310
Yes, there's no doubt.

30
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,520
It's an Angel.

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,190
Episode One
Angel Attack

32
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,340
Every missile hit the target!

33
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm sorry! Thanks for waiting!

34
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,710
The target is still operational.
It's still heading towards New Tokyo-3.

35
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,310
The Air Defense Force doesn't have
the firepower to stop it!

36
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,290
Hit it with everything we've got!

37
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,250
Mobilize all of Atsugi and Iruma as well!

38
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,720
Don't hold anything back!
Destroy the target at any cost!

39
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,170
Why?! That was a direct hit!

40
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,040
The tank battalion's been annihilated.

41
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,980
Guided missiles and artillery
have no effect either.

42
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,520
It's no good! We'll never get anywhere
with the firepower we've got!

43
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,390
AT field: absolute terror field
Is it an AT field after all?

44
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,520
Yes. Conventional weapons are
useless against Angels.
AT field: absolute terror field

45
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,340
Yes. Conventional weapons are
useless against Angels.

46
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,990
I understand. We'll activate it as planned.

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,290
Hey, don't tell me...

48
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,230
They're going to use an N² mine?!

49
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,760
Get down!

50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,430
We did it!

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,890
Sorry, but it looks like you won't be
getting a shot at it.

52
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,160
Shock wave approaching.

53
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,700
Are you all right?

54
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,110
Yeah, but my mouth is full of dirt.

55
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,070
That's okay. Now then, here we go!

56
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,080
One, two!

57
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,440
There.

58
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,880
Thanks for the hand. I really appreciate it.

59
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,950
Thank you too, Katsuragi-san.

60
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,090
Just Misato is fine.

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm glad we've met at last, Ikari Shinji-kun.

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,020
Yeah...

63
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,830
What's the target's status?

64
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,800
We're unable to confirm due to
all the EMP interference.

65
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,640
You saw the size of the explosion. It's over.

66
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,140
Sensors restored.

67
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,280
We've got an energy reading
at the explosion's epicenter!

68
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,470
What the hell?!

69
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,180
Visual display restored.

70
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,680
That was our last resort.

71
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,530
How can this be?

72
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,150
Damned monster!

73
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes. Don't worry about it.

74
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,630
His safety is my top priority,
so could you get a car train ready for us?

75
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,940
A direct one.

76
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,780
Right.

77
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,480
Well, I volunteered to pick him up,

78
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,180
so I'll make sure he gets there. See ya!

79
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,950
Man, this sucks! I just had my car restored
and it's a total wreck already!

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,560
33 more loan payments to go,
plus the cost of repairs.

81
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,970
And look! My best dress has been ruined!

82
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,160
Excuse me, Misato-san?
And look! My best dress has been ruined!

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,540
Excuse me, Misato-san?

84
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,790
And I was looking and feeling so nice.
Excuse me, Misato-san?

85
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,300
And I was looking and feeling so nice.

86
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,980
Excuse me, Misato-san?

87
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,660
What?

88
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,400
Are you sure you can just take those?

89
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,210
Never mind about that!

90
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,050
It's an emergency, and we need
a working car right now, right?

91
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,610
And I'm an international government
official, after all,

92
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,280
so everything's going to be
perfectly fine, okay?

93
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,290
I don't think anyone will buy that.

94
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,460
You're no fun. You look cute,
but you're kind of a cold fish.

95
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,730
You think so?

96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,530
Oh, did I upset you?

97
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,670
Sorry about that! You are a boy, after all.

98
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,040
And you're pretty childish for your age.

99
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,680
As we predicted, it's regenerating itself.

100
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,850
If it couldn't, it wouldn't be
a practical autonomous weapon.

101
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,090
Impressive. It appears it can even upgrade
its own operational functions.

102
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,690
And it seems to have gotten smarter.

103
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,630
It's only a matter of time before
it resumes attacking.

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,300
The gates are now closing.
Please stand clear.

105
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,610
The special duty organization Nerv?
The gates are now closing.
Please stand clear.

106
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,030
Now departing.
The special duty organization Nerv?

107
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,140
Now departing.

108
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,340
Yes, it's a secret organization under
the control of the United Nations.
Now departing.

109
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,450
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.
Yes, it's a secret organization under
the control of the United Nations.

110
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:51,950
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

111
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,580
That's where my father is, right?
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

112
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,750
Well, yeah.
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

113
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,750
Do you know what he does?
This is the C-22 Special Express
departing directly for G33-1.

114
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,690
This train will bypass all other stations.
Please stand back.

115
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,920
My teacher told me his work is vital
for the protection of the human race.
This train will bypass all other stations.
Please stand back.

116
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,520
My teacher told me his work is vital
for the protection of the human race.

117
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,830
From this point forward, command of this
operation will be entrusted to you.

118
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,530
Show us what you're capable of.

119
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,690
Yes, Sir.

120
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,370
Ikari-kun, we will admit that our weapons
have no effect on the target.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
But are you sure you can beat this thing?

122
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,830
It's what Nerv was created for.

123
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,140
Let's hope you're correct.

124
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,910
The target is still stationary.

125
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,350
Our intercept system is currently
7.5% operational.

126
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,360
So, even the UN forces have retired.

127
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,020
What are you going to do?

128
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,520
I intend to activate Unit 01.

129
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,860
Unit 01? But we have no pilot.

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,100
That's not a problem. Another spare
will be delivered soon.

131
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,800
Are you taking me to my father?

132
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,400
Yes. Pretty much.

133
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,510
Father...

134
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,450
Oh, that's right. Did you get
an ID card from your father?

135
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,350
Yes.

136
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,050
Here it is.

137
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,880
Thanks.

138
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,430
<b>Ikari Gendo
Come.
Thanks.

139
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,090
<b>Come.
Ikari Gendo

140
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,090

Nerv...

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,260
My father's agency.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,060
Am I going to work for them too?

147
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,500
Of course.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,810
He wouldn't have sent me a letter unless
he needed me for something.

149
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,240
I see. So you don't get along with your father.

150
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,240
It's the same with me.

151
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,490
Awesome!

152
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,390
It's the real Geo-Front!

153
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,360
That's right.

154
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,870
This is our secret base.
Nerv Headquarters.

155
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,800
This is the key to rebuilding our world.

156
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,340

This is why I hate wearing skirts here.

177
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,420
I'm sorry. I'm just not used to this place yet.

178
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,490
We passed this spot just a little while ago.

179
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,300
But don't worry about it.

180
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,240
They make these systems
to be used, you know.

181
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,970
Would the head of Project E,
Technical Department Division 1,

182
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,840
Dr. Akagi Ritsuko, Dr. Akagi Ritsuko,

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,480
please contact Captain Katsuragi Misato
of Operations, Division 1, immediately.

184
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,450
I don't believe it.

185
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,420
She got lost again, didn't she?

186
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,950
Uh, hiya, Ritsuko.

187
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,990
What were you doing, Captain Katsuragi?

188
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,330
We're short on both time
and manpower, you know.

189
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,860
Sorry!

190
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,970
So this is the boy?

191
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,980
Right. According to the Marduk report,
he's the "Third Child".

192
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,770
I'm glad to meet you.

193
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,680
Huh? Sure.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,880
He's just like his father.
Like how he's unendearing.

195
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,510
I'll leave the rest to you.

196
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,190
Their first meeting in over three years.

197
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,890
Vice Commander, the target
has started moving again.

198
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,370
Right. All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

199
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,910
Repeat. All personnel, assume
battle stations, Level One.

200
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,300
Prepare for ground-unit interception.

201
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,040
Here we go.

202
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,270
It sounds pretty serious.

203
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,580
So, how's Unit 01 doing?

204
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,950
It's currently in refrigeration,
using the B-type equipment.

205
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,950
Does it really work?
It's never worked before, right?

206
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,890
The possibility of activation is 0.000000001%.

207
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,990
We call it, pathetically enough,
the O-9 System.

208
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,660
Does that mean it doesn't work?

209
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,130
Oh, don't be insulting. It's not zero.

210
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,830
Well, it's just a number.

211
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,430
Anyway, it's a bit too late to be saying,
"Sorry, it didn't work".

212
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,810
Huh? It's completely dark.

213
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,150
A face? A giant robot?

214
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,020
You won't find this in the manual.

215
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,130
This is mankind's ultimate
multipurpose decisive weapon,

216
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,040
the synthetic human Evangelion, Unit 01.

217
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,280
Built in absolute secrecy,
it is mankind's trump card.

218
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Is this part of what my father's been doing?

219
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,180
Correct.

220
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,480
It's been a while.

221
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,680
Father...

222
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,520
We're moving out!

223
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,480
Moving out?! Unit 00's still in
cryo-stasis, isn't it?

224
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,620
You're not planning to use Unit 01?!

225
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,960
There's no other way.

226
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,830
Hold on! Rei can't do it yet, can she?

227
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,170
We've got no pilot!

228
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,260
A pilot has just been delivered.

229
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,560
Are you serious?

230
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,610
Ikari Shinji-kun...

231
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,710
Yes?

232
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,730
You will pilot it.

233
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,440
But even Ayanami Rei took seven months
to synchronize with her Eva.

234
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,250
It's impossible for him to do it!
He just got here!

235
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,120
He just has to sit in the seat.
We don't expect more than that.

236
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,180
But...

237
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,920
Repelling that Angel is our ultimate priority.

238
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,020
To do that, we have no choice but to put
aboard the Eva whomever has the chance

239
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,620
to synchronize with it, no matter how slight.

240
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,800
I believe you know that, Captain Katsuragi.

241
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,600
I suppose...

242
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,610
Father, why did you send for me?

243
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,750
You know exactly why.

244
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,650
So, you're asking me to take this thing
and fight that thing?

245
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,350
That's right.

246
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,020
No way! Why are you doing this now?!

247
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,630
I thought you didn't need me!

248
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,820
I called you because I have a need for you.

249
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,830
Why me?

250
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,700
Because no one else can.

251
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,060
No, I can't...

252
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,030
I've never even seen anything
like this before! I can't do this!

253
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,410
You will be instructed.

254
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
But there's no way I can do this!

255
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,740
I can't pilot it!

256
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,240
If you're going to pilot it, do it now
and quickly. If not, leave!

257
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,460
It must have detected our location.

258
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,040
Shinji-kun, we don't have time.

259
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,240
Get into it.

260
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,980
No! I didn't come for this! This isn't fair!

261
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,690
Shinji-kun, just why did you come here?

262
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,690
You mustn't run! Not from your father,
and most of all not from yourself.

263
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,390
I know that! But there's no way I can do it!

264
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,530
Fuyutsuki...

265
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,250
Wake up Rei.

266
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,750
Can we use her?

267
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,310
She isn't dead.

268
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,580
I understand.

269
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,250
Rei.

270
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,390
Yes?

271
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,260
Our spare is unusable. You will do it again.

272
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,230
Yes, Sir.

273
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,930
Reconfigure Unit 01's system to Rei,
then re-activate!

274
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,990
Roger. Call off the present work,
and begin re-activation.

275
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,800
I knew it. I'm not needed after all.

276
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,700
Watch out!

277
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,890
The Eva moved!

278
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,090
What's going on?!

279
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,460
It broke the right arm restraint!

280
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,020
No, that's impossible!

281
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,730
It didn't even have an entry plug inserted!

282
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,960
There's no way it could have moved!

283
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,330
It reacted without any interface?!

284
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,200
Or was it protecting...

285
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,230
him?

286
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,530
We can do it.

287
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,160
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

288
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,320
I mustn't run away!

289
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,670
I'll do it.

290
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,490
I'll pilot it!

291
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,340
Cooling process, completed.

292
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,880
Right arm re-secured.

293
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,910
Cage contents now in position for docking.

294
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,850
Roger.

295
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,680
Signal terminator plug has been ejected.

296
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,820
Roger. Inserting entry plug.

297
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,880
Direct hydro-transmission system,
connection prepared.

298
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,430
Plug fixed in place.

299
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,160
First stage connection initiated.

300
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,900
Filling the entry plug.

301
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,470
What is this stuff?

302
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,450
Don't worry. Once your lungs
are filled with LCL,

303
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,210
your blood will be oxygenated directly.

304
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,550
You'll get used to it.

305
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,450
I feel nauseous.

306
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,720
Stop whining! You're a boy, aren't you?!

307
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,160
Connecting main power.

308
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,860
All circuits transmitting power.

309
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,700
Roger.

310
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,360
Commencing secondary contacts.

311
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,370
