Documentation for the fonts interface provided in OverLua
=========================================================

OverLua provides a simplified interface to create and manage Fontconfig
in-memory configurations, create FreeType font face objects from those
and basic manipulation of these font face objects.

It is possible to create cairo font face objects from the FreeType font
face objects, so the fonts can be used in cairo rendering. This is the
preferred way to produce text in OverLua.

This interface does not provide means to have Fontconfig load and use
configuration files, neither system-wide, per-user nor private ones.
The only way to load and use fonts is to explicitly name the font files
and load these. The purpose of this is to let OverLua scripts produce
predictable results, as the same font will always be selected regardless
of the system the script is running on.

Font configuration object
-------------------------

OverLua keeps one global Fontconfig configuration object, which is
implicitly used for all operations. It is accessed through the global
'fonts' object.

The following operations are supported:


success = fonts.add_file(filename)

Attempts to load the specified font file and add all fonts in it to the
Fontconfig configuration. This uses the FcConfigAppFontAddFile C function
to perform the work.

On return, 'success' is a boolean which is 'true' on success and 'false'
otherwise.


cairofont = fonts.select(pattern, cairofo)

Select the font best matching the pattern given, and return an object
representing that font.

The pattern is a Lua table of key=value pairs, with the keys being the
properties Fontconfig understands, and the values the value you want
for that property.

'cairofo' is a cairo font options object. This parameter is optional.

You can see a list of known properties on: <http://fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html>

This function returns a cairo FreeType font object that can be selected
into a cairo context for rendering with.
